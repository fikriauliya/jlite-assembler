Test files:
test_6params.txt:
    Tests that if a method is called with more parameters than there are parameter registers, then the parameters that can't fit into the parameter registers are stored on the stack and referenced correctly.

test_booleans.txt:
    Tests that the boolean operations || and && work correctly.

test_class.txt:
    Tests that creating a class works properly and that you can access a field of a class where the class itself is a field in another class, as well as assigning, reading a value and invoking methods of such a field.

test_fields.txt:
    Tests that you can write to a field in a class and that invoking a method by using object reference works correctly. Also tests that you can read from a field.

test_functions1.txt:
    Tests recursion by a recursive factorial function.

test_if.txt:
    Tests if stmt, using nested if stmts and different kind of expressions in the condition, and that the relational operators >,<,>=,<=,!=,== works correctly.

test_while.txt:
    Tests that the while stmt works correctly, using nested while stmts and different kind of expressions in the condition.

test_string.txt:
    Tests that assigning strings and using a variable of type String in a print stmt work correctly.

test_ops.txt:
    Tests an expression with many operators to see that the registers are allocated correctly.

test_object_parameter.txt:
    Tests that you can send an object as parameter and that you can access the fields of the object and change the fields.
